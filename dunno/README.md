# Work

1. Make seperate js file with code.
2. Make it easier to add animations.
3. Improve parser code to support grouping and chaining

```
(a,b,c)|d|e
```

4. Make animation step optional
5. Make multiple animations at the same animation steps run at once.
6. Improve animation definition system
    * Maybe shift to js keyframes
    * Maybe let users save animations in the animation language (a,b)|c|d
7. Allow for more complex param passing.
8. Add ability to control start/end (if to remove from dom or hide until start)
9. Add ability to loop.
