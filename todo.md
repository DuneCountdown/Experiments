# Index page 

add the ability to chuck in a list of features in the config json for the index page. This can get rendered into a nice formatted list when the sidebar draw opens up describing a ap;lication. 

# Podder

Display the feed as a timeline esque view with cards on the right and a line with dots on the left. 
Also tally up each episode etc so you can say "will take 42h to listen to all" or have a calculator to say "with new episodes releasing every x weeks it would take you y weeks to be up to date with z episodes listened per week"

Have the ability to link the site to someone else with a rss feed embedded in the url so it renders on click. 

Add import options.
